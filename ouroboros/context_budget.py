"""Single source of truth for AGENT-context size budgets.

These govern the size of Ouroboros's OWN working context: the main-loop
assembled prompt, tool-history compaction triggers, and the background
consciousness context guards.

They are deliberately SEPARATE from the REVIEW-prompt budget family
(``ouroboros.tools.review_helpers.REVIEW_PROMPT_TOKEN_BUDGET`` and the
``ouroboros.tools.scope_review`` window constants), which sizes reviewer
prompts, not the agent's own context. Merging the two would couple unrelated
concerns and is explicitly avoided.

Constants only (no functions) so this module stays free against the codebase
function-count gate (``ouroboros.review.MAX_TOTAL_FUNCTIONS``). Profile-keyed
resolution (the low/max context modes) is layered on later without renaming
these constants.

Char-based guards assume the ~chars/4 estimate (``ouroboros.utils.estimate_tokens``);
the comments give the approximate token equivalents.
